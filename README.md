# Richonguzman / CD2RXU LoRa APRS Tracker/Station
# (Firmware for Tx and Rx !!!)

### This repo is a fork of Richonguzman's Tracker with adjusted parameters in config. If you like the work of Ricardo - support him. Either as <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/richonguzman" target="_blank">sponsor on github</a> or directly via <a href="http://paypal.me/richonguzman" target="_blank">paypal</a>.

NOTE: To take advantage of Tx/Rx capabilities you should have an Tx/Rx LoRa iGate (near you) like:

https://github.com/richonguzman/LoRa_APRS_iGate or the fork https://github.com/Mane76/LoRa_APRS_iGate_2nd_gen

____________________________________________________
- NOW WE HAVE A MENU (just pushing the central button IO38)
    - Saving, Reading and Deleting Messages.
    - Asking Weather Report
    - Listening to other Trackers arround.
    - Changing Display Eco Mode (turn off after 4 seg).
- Processor from 240Mhz to 80MHz to save almost 20% power consumption (from ~ 100mA to almost ~80mA) (Thanks Mane76).
- All GPS beacons/packet are encoded for less time on RF/LoRa Tx.
- 4th line of the OLED SCREEN shows Altitude+Speed+Course or Number of New Messages Received.
- 5th line of the OLED SCREEN shows Recent Heard Trackers/Station/iGates Tx.

# INSTRUCTIONS:
- (1). Change _Callsign_, _Symbol_ and _Comment_ and adopt _frequency_ (to omit the offset of TTGOs) and _path_ (empty for byte-saving, WIDE1-1 for safe usage of Digipeater) to your needs on /data/tracker_config.json
- (2). Upload this changes via Platformio --> Upload Filesystem Image (to your TTGO Board)
- (3). Build and Upload the Firmware with Platformio in VSCODE

If you encounter any problem choose in Platformio "erase flash" and repeat step (2) and (3).
